              A Critical Response: Remembering the Forgotten in “The Dog of
              Tetwal”

            Saadat Hasan Manto’s “The Dog of Tetwal” is set in the aftermath of
            the Partition of India, portraying a village in Jammu and Kashmir as
            a no man’s land where the war is a microcosmic representation of the
            ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. The
            realist fiction focuses on toxic ultranationalism, using the dog as
            an allegory to explore the identity crisis faced by millions of
            refugees caught in the futility and absurdity of the Partition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Manto illustrates the futility of drawing borders by highlighting
            the similarities between Indians and Pakistanis, suggesting that the
            Partition was unnecessary. From Jamadar Harnam Singh and Bashir
            “softly humming” love songs from their respective camps (193) to
            their shared morning routines, Manto establishes that both sides
            share strikingly similar habits. However, the most remarkable
            resemblance was in their use of the Hindustani vernacular to name
            the dog, as both groups chose onomatopoeically similar phrases –
            “Chapad Jhunjhun” (191) and “Sapar Sunsun” (196). Neither of the
            names are standard phrases, but both are playful expressions used to
            describe sound and rhythmic movement, making them phonetic
            duplicates. Manto’s revelation of these similarities demonstrates
            the impracticality of drawing borders between people who share a
            common language and lifestyle because both sides share enough common
            interests to coexist peacefully despite their religious differences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Manto highlights the soldiers’ toxic ultranationalism, a result of
            Partition, to urge his readers to reconsider the nature of their
            national identity. As the dog arrives at their respective camps,
            neither Harnam Singh nor Subedar Himmat Khan can accept it for what
            it is and are compelled to label it to signify its nationality. This
            common propensity for assigning binary national identities
            demonstrates that they saw the innocent animal as an enemy rather
            than a living being, while also reiterating the striking
            similarities between Indians and Pakistanis, such that they even
            share the same animosity towards those who are not their own. Having
            lost all sense of humanity and respect for life, Harnam Singh and
            Himmat Khan’s unceasing bullet shots toward the dog at the end of
            the narrative not only revealed their shared inclination to
            retaliate when the other attack, but also their common sadistic
            personalities found the dog’s fear to be “a great deal of pleasure”
            (198). Manto uses the soldiers’ compassionless behavior toward the
            dog to mock the concept of extreme nationalism, which is often
            upheld through performative acts of aggression and implores
            post-Partition readers to reconsider their understanding of
            nationalism. Manto also relates this ultranationalism with the
            absurdity of the Partition by amplifying the innocence of the dog,
            who, despite being an animal, felt more humanity than the “human”
            soldiers themselves, because it looked up to them as trustworthy and
            kind human beings, not as vindictive Indians or Pakistanis. This
            urges present-day readers to imagine the betrayal the refugees of
            the Partition might have faced in relying on the soldiers for
            support and understanding but to no avail.
          </p>
          <p>
            Manto uses Harnam Singh and Himmat Khan’s shared proclivity for
            nationalistic labeling to address the identity crisis that affected
            many refugees during the Partition. Through the rapid naming and
            renaming of the dog from “Chapad Jhunjhun” (191) to “Sapar Sunsun”
            (196), Manto establishes identity as a transitory attribute, making
            a commentary on the fluid identities of the Partition refugees,
            which included Manto and his family as well. The dog’s metaphorical
            struggle limping between two identities, and its literal struggle
            between two borders during its last moments allegorizes the
            disorientation and displacement of many refugees, who, without any
            firm identities during the Partition, were going just as astray in
            real life as the dog does in this realist narrative.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story’s climax, where the dog is unsafe in India, Pakistan, and
            even in no man’s land, conveys the situational irony of a war that
            fails to secure anyone’s safety. Manto deliberately builds this
            suspense to demonstrate that the Partition only benefitted the
            authorities who were unwaveringly committed to building extremist,
            non-secular nations, and pays homage to those who were lost and
            forgotten – those who “died a dog’s death” (199).
