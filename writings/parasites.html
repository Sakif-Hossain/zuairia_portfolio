          <p>
            Bong Joon-ho’s 2019 South Korean dark comedy Parasite provides a
            satirical account of the class difference between two families, the
            working-class Kims and the wealthy Parks. It demonstrates the Kims
            infiltrating the lives and household of the Parks in search of
            better lives. Using physical spaces, metaphors, and necropolitics as
            frameworks, Bong critiques the systemic dehumanization and “social
            death” inflicted upon the Kims. Ultimately, Parasite portrays
            capitalism as a necropolitical system that distinguishes the working
            class as the parasites and pests of society, who are sacrificed so
            that the upper class may thrive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bong’s portrayal of physical spaces depicts the influence of spatial
            necropolitics in the Kims’ lives. While the Parks reside on a hill
            in a tastefully designed, spacious home (Parasite 13:27-14:07), the
            Kims are confined to a dark, cramped, semi-basement apartment, where
            they struggle to make ends meet (01:01-03:19). The Kims’
            neighborhood is in a low-income area that is often adversely
            affected by pollution, uncleanliness, and a urinating drunkard
            (06:08-32). Unlike the Parks’ affluent neighborhood, the Kims’
            poverty-stricken neighborhood and semi-basement apartment are also
            prone to flooding with sewage water (01:35:40-01:36:53). This
            creates a zone of death as the Kims are segregated into spaces with
            limited access to healthcare, clean water, and sanitation, exposing
            them to severe health risks. As such, they significantly lose
            control over their health and bodies. Such debilitating
            circumstances, Sang-Keun Yoo explains, subject the Kims to
            necropolitical environmental toxicity, where systemic forces compel
            working-class populations to endure life-threatening conditions (Yoo
            62). Achille Mbembe’s “necropolitics” – which refers to the
            institutional powers that govern which populations should live and
            which must die (Mbembe 92) – provides a framework to understand the
            Kims’ challenges. Seoul’s semi-basement apartments were originally
            built in the 1970s during the Cold War to serve as emergency
            shelters, but “became permanent dwellings” due to a housing crisis
            (Yoo 63). These conditions render the Kims partially dead, as they
            are partly buried in a substandard residential environment and are
            subject to conditions that strip them of agency and dignity.
            Likewise, Geun-sae’s condition in the Parks’ basement further
            resembles a living corpse fully deprived of necessities (Parasite
            01:09:01-10). In contrast, the Parks are not subject to the same
            toxic environmental conditions as the Kims or Geun-sae, suggesting
            how spatial necropolitics predisposes working-class populations to
            adversity and health crises while protecting the upper class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Serving as a bleak commentary on class-specific environmental
            toxicity and spatial necropolitics is the architectural build of the
            Kims’ toilet, which becomes a symbol of their poverty (Yoo 63). With
            “the city’s sewer pipeline [running] higher than the floor” (63),
            The Kims are forced to climb the stairs for even the most basic
            human functions. The health risks of such endangered spaces evoke
            sympathy for Geun-sae as he represents the working-class population
            that is even more dilapidated, invisible, and marginalized than the
            Kims. As an individual who is hiding from loan sharks (Parasite
            01:09:12), he is factually homeless. Additionally, by imagining a
            metaphorical “wedding” ceremony (01:22:31-48) in the basement
            bunker, Geun-sae indicates his comfort in such precarious
            conditions. Agreeably, Yoo’s claim that “the most terrifying aspect
            of [Geun-sae’s] metamorphosis is his normalization of necropolitical
            conditions” (Yoo 61) is persuasive, because Geun-sae’s behavior
            reflects his psychological adaptation to and wholehearted acceptance
            of substandard living conditions, reflecting his loss of rights over
            his body and mind. Geun-sae’s state is what Mbembe aptly describes
            as “social death,” a condition where one loses control of their
            home, body, and political agency (Mbembe 75). The Kims’ and
            Geun-sae’s tolerance of such spatial inequality and environmental
            toxicity underscores how necropolitical exploitation can become so
            seamlessly integrated into the minds of the working class that they
            begin to identify with a life that is determined by death,
            devastation, and dehumanization.
          </p>
          <p>
            The precarious conditions of the spaces that the Kims and Geun-sae
            are seen in depict the predatory nature of capitalism, suggesting a
            neglect of the working-class populations on the system’s part to the
            extent that it subjects these populations to death-like
            circumstances. The capitalist system in Parasite resonates with
            Mbembe’s concept of “sovereign,” the higher constitution that
            “largely resides in the power and capacity to dictate who is able to
            live and who must die” (Mbembe 66). Mijeong Kim explains that this
            neglect could be largely because the system views the Kims as a
            “surplus” to the economy who do not deserve to be saved (Kim 22).
            These boundaries underscore how capitalism cancels the working-class
            populations so that the wealthy can flourish. One might therefore
            argue that Bong portrays capitalism as a necropolitical system that
            governs lives not for the benefit of individuals (Simpson) but for
            the functioning of the system and the maintenance of social
            hierarchies. Consequently, it feels reasonable to posit that the
            Kims’ apartment is not only a portrayal of the working-class’
            subterranean existence but also their undeniable proximity to death.
            Death is almost declared and imposed upon the Kims and Geun-sae, and
            as working-class individuals who do not possess any power, they
            cannot escape this institutional control. Instead, they internalize
            these mechanisms of control, demonstrating how necropolitical
            influence forces the working class to transform into languid and
            almost lifeless, or, “[socially dead]” entities (Mbembe 75).
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides treating them as living corpses, necropolitical forces also
            subject the Kims to subhuman treatment. When city workers spray
            insecticide near their semi-basement apartment, Ki-taek insists on
            leaving the windows open to benefit from the “free” fumigation
            (Parasite 03:24-55). As the chemicals used during fumigations in
            Korea are “heavily toxic to human bodies” and increase air toxicity,
            Yoo’s argument about the health risks being greater in the Kims’
            neighborhood than in the Park mansion is logical (Yoo 64), but one
            might explicate that the fumigator in this instance symbolizes the
            necropolitical influence that swears to eradicate the Kims, as
            though they are pests (Farahbakhsh and Ebrahimi 99). This represents
            the dehumanization of the working class (Simpson), as the fumigator
            literally and metaphorically “metamorphosizes” (Yoo 66) the Kims
            into disease-causing insects. The pest imagery recurs when
            Chung-sook jokingly compares Ki-taek to a cockroach that would hide
            if Mr. Park suddenly returned home (Parasite 01:01:53-58), and that
            is what precisely happens as Ki-taek hides under a table upon Mr.
            Park’s return (01:25:35). Cockroaches are often associated with
            filth and darkness, and this imagery underscores that the poor, like
            pests, often remain hidden in the presence of the wealthy. Albeit
            jokingly, Chung-sook’s dialogue echoes the societal constraints that
            the working class must accept to survive in a capitalist system.
            Alternatively, Alireza Farahbakhsh and Ramtin Ebrahimi also offer
            another interpretation of this scene, mentioning that the Kims “can
            only become themselves in the shadow of the rich, or through hiding
            their true identity during the day” (99). Accordingly, this fear and
            instinct for survival attaches an almost non-human, vampiric
            characteristic to the Kims, as they embrace their identities only at
            night, away from the eyes of the Parks. The cockroach imagery thus
            critiques the necropolitical “sovereign” (Mbembe 79) that promises
            the wealthy a life of light, comfort, and luxury by sharpening the
            boundaries between the upper- and working classes, predetermining
            the latter to both social and literal death.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Kims metamorphosize into subhuman, insect-like creatures, the
            metaphor of the title Parasite takes greater significance.
            Effectively, Bong invites his audience to recognize that the pest
            references and the metaphorical connotations of the film’s title are
            interwoven (Simpson). Although the cockroach imagery exclusively
            signals the subhuman treatment of the Kims, the parasite metaphor
            functions omnidirectionally (Simpson). The Kims and Geun-sae are
            undeniably parasitic to the Parks. However, the Parks are equally
            parasitic to the Kims. The Parks remain oblivious to the challenges
            the Kims undergo (Parasite 01:44:18-32) but continually rely on them
            for the various laborious services that help manage their lifestyle.
            While the Parks assume that they are immune to hardships, the
            violence in the climax of the film (01:50:56-01:56:15) suggests
            otherwise. As the rich experience the same outcomes as the poor –
            literal death – the dual function of the parasite metaphor further
            unravels. Although Ki-taek knows that Mr. Park is repulsed by his
            odor, his galvanizing moment of recognition strikes only when
            Geun-sae is subjected to the same aversion (Simpson). This suggests
            that the actions of the necropolitical system produce repercussions
            that are problematic to the system itself – the thematic violence
            portrayed throughout the film manifests literally in the climax
            (Simpson) as the system’s reliance on exploiting and dehumanizing
            the poor backfires. This collapse of social hierarchy reveals that
            the systemic violence that is confined to the working class can
            dissipate, implicating even the wealthy into chaos, destruction, and
            death.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bong’s Parasite portrays capitalism as a necropolitical system that
            normalizes the exploitation and dehumanization of the working class.
            Bong’s film ultimately prompts us to understand that class and
            wealth disparities are universal challenges and various global
            systems of power often determine who is deemed worthy of a dignified
            existence and who is destined for death – social or literal. But,
            most importantly, Bong uses his film as a reminder that we can all
            find ourselves in the same plight as the Kims unless collective
            action is taken to prevent these systemic forces from invading our
            lives.
