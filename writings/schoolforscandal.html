            The rake and the libertine are two figures of elite masculinity that
            occupied pivotal roles in the culture and literary history of the
            eighteenth century. Both archetypes often diverged from the accepted
            social norms of the period and lived unrestrained lives. These terms
            were often used interchangeably as pejoratives to describe men who
            practiced little to no sexual restraint or moral responsibility.
            However, this essay will draw distinctions between the rake and the
            libertine by examining their representation in Eliza Haywood’s
            Fantomina; or, Love in a Maze, and Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s The
            School for Scandal. This close analysis will argue that the titular
            heroine in Fantomina is an abled female rake, although she displays
            libertine qualities as well, and Beauplaisir personifies a disabled
            rake, defying accepted gender norms of the period. This paper will
            also argue that Charles Surface in The School for Scandal has the
            outward appearance of a libertine, but is a character who captures
            the sociopolitical tensions of the eighteenth century as the society
            transitions from the Stuart to the Hanoverian era. By emphasizing
            the differences between the rake’s charismatic appeal and the
            libertine’s philosophical rebellion, this analysis aims to
            underscore the eighteenth century’s gender dynamics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of the characteristics possessed by the rake and the libertine
            overlap, such as their shared inclination toward sexual
            gratification. However, upon analyzing and comparing the characters
            of Charles Surface and Beauplaisir, the distinctions between both
            archetypes become vivid. Throughout The School for Scandal, Charles
            is addressed numerous times as “that libertine” (Sheridan 974),
            “wild, extravagant, young rogue” (986), and “profligate” (979).
            Charles’ reputation of behaving recklessly and misspending his
            inheritance on parties (986) sharply juxtaposes that of his
            seemingly virtuous brother, Joseph Surface (979). Joseph pretends to
            be a moral and virtuous gentleman but is a lying hypocrite (1005).
            The contrast between the Surface brothers sets up the disparity
            between appearance and reality, the central theme of the play. While
            Charles’ extravagant lifestyle undeniably places him in precarious
            situations such as bankruptcy, his generosity and kindness often go
            unnoticed. One could argue that his benevolence toward Mr. Stanley
            (Sheridan 998) and his refusal to “part with” Sir Oliver’s portrait
            (979) symbolize an intrinsic honesty, understanding, and loyalty
            that are not commonly seen in rakes or libertines. Unlike most rakes
            and libertines, Charles also does not demonstrate an excessive
            desire for sexual gratification. Instead, he displays virtue when he
            refrains from taking Maria’s surname at the party to avoid
            identifying her, despite his friends’ insistence (Sheridan 992).
            This act of sentimentality reveals that his admiration for Maria may
            be more compassionate than carnal, and although he may appear a
            libertine or rake, his actions demonstrate deep-seated respect for
            women, setting him apart from the stereotypical traits of the
            archetypes. The dissimilarities between Charles’ characteristics and
            the libertine’s common traits could be due to the Hanoverian
            succession, when George I assumed the throne of Great Britain in
            1714, and the social reform began (Robertson). Daniel Gustafson
            clarifies that as Great Britain withstood the transition from the
            Stuart to the Hanoverian era, moral principles, and social norms
            drastically transformed. The rake and the libertine archetypes also
            underwent significant changes (Gustafson 359). Inspired by
            absolutism and authority (361), the Stuart rake had “an unrestrained
            personal will” that was often in competition with the Hanoverian
            preference for the “emerging ideals of the polite gentleman” (362).
            During the Hanoverian cultural reform, “the Restoration rake
            [underwent] a progress of teleological decline” (362) but persisted
            on stage through George Etherege’s Restoration comedies (Gustafson
            370). The liminal but definite existence of the rake during this
            political period is reflected in Charles’ behavior; he is neither
            the polite, responsible, moral Hanoverian gentleman nor the
            experienced, womanizing, misogynistic Stuart absolutist. Aptly
            embodying the impact of the sociopolitical transition, Charles
            effectively reveals the changing dynamics of gender and sexuality in
            the eighteenth century.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Charles captures the sociopolitical tensions and societal
            transitions of the eighteenth century, the resemblance between him
            and a libertine often causes others to misunderstand him and reveals
            their limited understanding of what constitutes a true libertine.
            The townspeople’s negative reactions toward Charles’ outwardly
            libertine behavior suggest that the moral values of sensibility,
            balance, restraint, order, decorum, and rationality were highly
            regarded in the eighteenth century, while attitudes – such as that
            of Charles – that diverged from such neoclassical values were
            scorned (Robertson). One could contend that through Charles,
            Sheridan attempts to solve the eighteenth century’s
            misunderstandings regarding elite masculinities, declaring that what
            is outwardly presented is not necessarily genuine. The courtier and
            poet John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, is described by Lisa
            O’Connell as the most notable Restoration libertine, whose “dashing
            and extravagant persona” inspired various dramatic characters in
            court-licensed theatres in London after 1660 (O’Connell 219).
            Libertinage emerged with the influence of the Italian satirist
            Pietro Aretino and the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes (220-224).
            Aretino’s argument about sex is a natural phenomenon “deployed
            obscenity against established authority” (221) and inspired the
            creation of the amatory fiction genre that was later dominated by
            female authors like Haywood (222). Additionally, because Hobbes
            rejected political and religious dogma, a way of life that was
            withdrawn from society was considered “a condition of living well”
            (O’Connell 222), promoting the libertine’s philosophical,
            irreligious, and intellectually provocative behavior that broadly
            defied morality and authority. Consequently, it can be concluded
            that regardless of the libertine’s indulgence in sexual
            gratification and extravagance, they were philosophically
            rebellious, and their greater purpose was to defy the established
            moral and religious structures. Their engagement in sexual conquests
            did not seek the immediate, personal gratification that the rakes
            pursued. As Charles does not philosophically challenge society, or
            have an insatiable hunger for sexual pursuits, he is not reminiscent
            of the libertine or the rake. Charles’ sentiments, honesty, and
            kindness do not conform to the defiance and rebellion that a
            libertine with “Hobbist modes” (O’Connell 228) would demonstrate, or
            the sexual hunger an eighteenth-century rake would crave (O’Connell
            228-229). There is, therefore, a strong claim to be made that
            through Charles, Sheridan ultimately exposes how one could have a
            truly sensible heart underneath their outwardly libertine behavior.
            Sheridan also uses Charles to uncover how interwoven the traits of
            rakish and libertine masculinities are, and how these overlapping
            traits may have obscured the eighteenth-century audience’s
            understanding of the distinctions between the archetypes.
          </p>

            Unlike Charles, Beauplaisir possesses more womanizing and rakish
            qualities as an individual who lacks loyalty and commitment. With
            his name translating into “beautiful pleasure” in French
            (Robertson), his character aptly embodies rakish masculinity. Sexual
            gratification is clearly crucial to Beauplaisir, but so is the act
            of engaging with multiple women, because the longer he stays with
            one lady, the more “tasteless and insipid” she appears to him
            (Haywood 636), not to mention that he enjoys taking the “liberty to
            pursue new conquests” (637) to enrich his collection of “highly
            rapturous” victories (635). Beauplaisir’s desire-driven nature
            evokes readers to critique his inability to commit to long-term
            relationships, exposing how rakes grow weary of women once their
            novelty fades (Robertson). By assigning such predictable behavioral
            patterns to Beauplaisir’s rakish character, Haywood ridicules the
            male gaze, which compels women to reinvent themselves continually if
            they are to maintain a man’s attention (Robertson). Beauplaisir’s
            lack of loyalty and commitment strikingly contrasts with Fantomina’s
            unwavering determination to sustain his affection, which not only is
            a demonstration of her emotional complexity but also serves as a
            testament to her intellectually challenging and manipulating the
            societal norms of the period (Robertson). Beauplaisir’s limited
            emotional depth further comments on how an eighteenth-century rake’s
            need for physical fulfillment overrules morality, courteousness, and
            consideration; Beauplaisir “[compels Celia] to sit in his lap” and
            “[devours] her lips… with greedy kisses,” without acknowledging that
            she was “half-reluctant” to his behavior and did not fully consent
            to such intimacy (Haywood 638). This indifference to the absence of
            consent during sexual activities acts as a microcosm of the
            eighteenth century’s social constructs regarding gender hierarchies,
            which promised men like Beauplaisir – rakish or not – absolute
            freedom of movement but imposed limitations on women like Fantomina.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Haywood gives Beauplaisir ultimate freedom in Fantomina,
            one could contend that she purposely uses him as a narrative tool to
            highlight Fantomina’s rakish, or, borderline libertine femininity.
            One could interpret Beauplaisir’s predictability as the leverage
            that allows Fantomina to experiment with her identity and autonomy
            because she calculates his moves before he contemplates them
            (Robertson). Upon noting “[Beauplaisir’s] inconstancy and levity of
            nature” (Haywood 641), she plans “another project… which she soon
            [ripens] into action” (641). Although notably naïve at the beginning
            of the play (Robertson), Fantomina’s increasing adaptability and
            mastery of theatrics with each disguise marks her resilience. Based
            on this premise, one could assert that the ability to possess such
            tremendous mental faculties in a society that was known to be
            patriarchal almost transforms Fantomina into a libertine, who, at a
            more profound level, was philosophically rebelling against the
            long-established constraints imposed on women. Through her
            unyielding pursuit of sexual desires and agency, she not only
            escapes the limitations of her “distinguished birth” (632) but also
            demonstrates that women in the eighteenth century were just as
            capable of defying morality and intellectually challenging society
            as their male counterparts. Consequently, Haywood’s use of
            Beauplaisir as a narrative device inspires more female agency and
            resilience within the patriarchal, eighteenth-century society. For
            such a remarkable philosophical rebellion, it would be natural to
            classify Fantomina as a libertine. However, her unfaltering sexual
            appetite aligns her more closely with the rake. Despite feeling
            “deceived and cheated [by Beauplaisir]” and having no “real
            tenderness for him,” she proceeds to disguise herself as Incognita
            to continue her scheme (641) instead of bringing it to an end
            (Robertson). Fantomina’s attempts to extend her plot provoke one to
            consider that the “luxurious gratification of [her] wild desires”
            (640) is of utmost importance to her. Until she is prevented by
            moral authority – in essence, her mother – her carnal urges take
            precedence over the larger battle she has against eighteenth-century
            society, as well as her self-respect and dignity. By not allowing
            Fantomina to fully transform into a female libertine, Haywood
            solidifies the differences between the rake and the libertine and
            questions the eighteenth-century society for granting men space to
            experiment with their gender dynamics but punishing women for the
            same desires.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenges in categorizing Fantomina as a female rake
            underscores the idea that gender and sexuality in the eighteenth
            century operated on a spectrum, rather than fitting neatly into the
            binary categories of the rake and the libertine. Often lost in such
            rigid categorizations is the case of the literary character’s
            ability, or lack thereof, to adhere to and fulfill the needs and
            expectations of these archetypes. Difeng Chueh considers an
            often-overlooked aspect of libertine masculinity in the eighteenth
            century – its relation to disability. Through his close reading of
            Fantomina, Chueh concludes that Beauplaisir’s observation skills are
            central to his libertinism. With these skills – from offering the
            “usual salutations” to Fantomina at the playhouse (Haywood 633) to
            altering his behavior to seduce Celia (638) – Beauplaisir perfects
            his wooing tactics (Chueh 3). Chueh further asserts that the
            observation skills that make Beauplaisir a libertine ironically also
            become the qualities that discredit his status (3-4). Quoting Samuel
            Johnson’s fifth definition of the term “disable” – which is “to
            exclude as wanting proper qualifications” – Chueh asserts that
            Beauplaisir’s abled rake status begins to fail as the heroine
            advances in her plot because he loses his observation skills (Chueh
            4). This argument about the reversal of power between Beauplaisir
            and Fantomina is persuasive, but Chueh’s classification of
            Beauplaisir as a libertine is not. To problematize this
            interpretation of Beauplaisir’s masculinity, libertines, in the
            words of Johnson, are those who are “unconfined,” “[live] without
            restraint or law,” and “[pay] no regard to the precepts of religion”
            (Johnson). Based on Johnson’s definition, one could counter Chueh,
            because, despite Beauplaisir’s sexual endeavors with those seemingly
            below his station, Beauplaisir respects law and religion; he does
            not trespass the boundaries of politeness and morality when he
            courts the Lady in her “drawing room” and refrains from “using with
            her that freedom” he would with a prostitute (Haywood 633). In this
            manner, Beauplaisir adheres more to religion and morality than rakes
            traditionally do and could be classified as a disabled rake who
            fails to meet the expectations of his fellow rakish, womanizing,
            amorous peers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the argument about observation skills being a marker
            of rakish identity explicates Fantomina’s success as an abled female
            rake and Charles’s failure as both a rake and libertine. According
            to Johnson, rakes are “loose, disorderly, vicious, wild, gay,
            thoughtless” and “addicted to pleasure” (Johnson). The last
            definition is especially resonant with Fantomina’s unwavering
            hypersexuality. While Fantomina and Beauplaisir both share a common
            desire to indulge in sexual gratification, she adheres to her rakish
            femininity more thoroughly than Beauplaisir does to his rakish
            masculinity. By repeatedly managing to trick Beauplaisir and always
            staying ahead of him, she inadvertently displays richer observation
            skills than him. Beauplaisir’s failure to recognize Fantomina’s
            disguises strikingly contrast with Fantomina’s adaptability and
            “qualifications,” which, according to Johnson’s definition of
            disability (Chueh), would license her as an abled rake. In this
            spectrum of the rake against the libertine, it seems reasonable to
            conclude that Beauplaisir clings to his disabled rake status, and
            Fantomina is an abled female rake, though she maintains some
            libertine qualities too. Conversely, Charles’ observation skills are
            poorer than Fantomina’s or Beauplaisir’s. Viewing people and
            situations only at face value, Charles’ lack of inquiry into others’
            motives often makes him appear naïve (Robertson). Not only does he
            fail to recognize Joseph’s superficial character (Sheridan 1004),
            but he also does not think it necessary to cross-examine Mr.
            Stanley’s background (998). Charles’ inability to discern Joseph’s
            duplicitous nature and failure to understand that anyone could have
            been posing as Mr. Stanley to financially exploit him further
            demonstrates his lack of observation skills, which could
            hypothetically eliminate his status as a rake or libertine, had he
            occupied either role.
          </p>
          <p>
            To conclude, Fantomina and The School for Scandal challenge the
            defined and specified understanding of gender, revealing how
            characters may embody rakish or libertine characteristics to varying
            extents. The distinctions drawn in this essay aim to highlight that
            those who are true rakes or libertines also possess certain
            qualities that allow them to meet the needs and expectations of
            their role. Conversely, those who merely perform or hold the outward
            appearance of a rake or libertine may not necessarily possess those
            attributes, signifying the obscurity and complexity of
            eighteenth-century gender dynamics. This close analysis invites
            further consideration of how female literary characters embodied
            libertine femininity, and the impact of their endeavors on
            eighteenth-century women.
