              A Critical Response: Patriarchal Oppression and Sexual Abuse in
              “Lihaaf”
            </h1>

            Ismat Chughtai’s Lihaaf is a short story that addresses patriarchal
            oppression and sexual abuse in 20th-century India. Chughtai’s use of
            the “quilt” as a metaphor, heat, and elephant motifs, and textile
            symbolism analogizes the Nawab’s exploitation of Begum Jaan as a
            façade for his homosexuality and Begum Jaan’s subsequent
            exploitation of Rabbu as a sexual slave. Demonstrating the
            transmission of psychological trauma down the social hierarchy,
            Lihaaf exhibits the vicious nature of hypersexuality and power
            dynamics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chughtai establishes the “quilt” metaphor to facilitate our
            understanding of the trauma the Nawab inflicted on Begum Jaan.
            Behind a façade of virtue, the Nawab’s attraction to young boys
            exposed his use of Begum Jaan as a “quilt” that concealed his
            homosexuality from societal scrutiny. Homosexuality was a taboo in
            Chughtai’s era, and his marriage protected him from accusations
            while enabling his sexual desires. The Nawab's behavior led to Begum
            Jaan feeling neglected, also portrayed through textile symbolism.
            The Nawab’s pursuit of sheer and translucent “gossamer shirts”
            symbolizes his lust-driven superficial character. Contrarily, the
            intricate embroidery in Begum Jaan’s “jaali karga kurtas” symbolizes
            her complex personality as a wife who was not propelled solely by
            carnal pleasures, but companionship as well. Begum Jaan’s isolation
            reflects the neglect many Indian women endured in patriarchal,
            loveless marriages where their needs were dismissed. Being confined
            in the Nawab’s house also diminished her existence to that of
            inanimate, forgotten objects, resembling the suppression and
            objectification women tolerated in the 1940s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chughtai’s use of heat as a central motif shows that the Nawab’s
            objectification and oppression of Begum Jaan escalates to abuse,
            which is perpetuated on Rabbu. By maintaining his association with
            male students, the Nawab repeatedly tortured Begum Jaan, making her
            “blood boil.” This trauma manifested as sexual abuse towards Rabbu
            and reduced her status to a mere sexual servant, as she was
            compelled to fulfill Begum Jaan’s unceasing demands for “special oil
            massages” and satiate her “itch.” Begum Jaan’s reliance on Rabbu to
            satisfy her sexual needs under the quilt and her growing
            irritability in Rabbu’s absence further highlights that she
            prioritized sexual pleasures over emotional fulfillment–a change
            induced by the Nawab’s misconduct. Chughtai’s continued employment
            of the “quilt” metaphor draws further parallels between the Nawab
            and Begum Jaan as sexual offenders; just as the Nawab used Begum
            Jaan as his “quilt,” Begum Jaan used Rabbu as hers–a pawn to achieve
            sexual satisfaction. This parallel also draws similarities between
            the Nawab and Begum Jaan as lecherous and self-serving oppressors
            who subjugated their social subordinates.
          </p>
          <p>
            The elephant motif highlights more correlations between Begum Jaan
            and the Nawab, enhancing our understanding of her hypersexuality. As
            Indian social norms often associate elephants with sensuality, the
            resemblance between her quilt’s shadow and a sexualized animal
            underscores her carnal urges. However, when juxtaposed with her
            elegant body, the elephant motif reveals that she uses physical
            beauty and grace as a façade to mask her hypersexual desires,
            mirroring the Nawab’s use of her as a cover for his own. Her
            heightened libido and oppressive nature parallel the patriarchal
            control that was once imposed on her by the Nawab, and her assertion
            of the same on Rabbu illustrates the dissemination of trauma through
            a power dynamic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chughtai’s reiteration of the heat motif illustrates the descent of
            sexual abuse upon the narrator through the social hierarchy. Upon
            “pressing” the narrator like “a clay doll” and disregarding her
            bodily autonomy, Begum Jaan reprises her role as a hypersexual
            oppressor who is aroused even by the narrator’s innocent touch and
            likes to dominate and objectify her sexually. The narrator’s later
            realization of the “quilt” as a symbol of her childhood trauma, and
            Chughtai’s characterization of it as a representation of patriarchal
            oppression and sexual abuse challenges the social hierarchy of
            20th-century India, where the powerful–like the Nawab and Begum
            Jaan–could exploit the defenseless–such as Rabbu and the
            narrator–without facing any consequences.
