          <p>A bus ride in Edmonton is a mosaic of stories.</p>
          <p>
            A mother rushes to get her son to school on time, balancing a
            steaming cup of espresso while her other hand clings to her
            toddler’s small, warm fingers. She tries to shake off the remnants
            of sleep with her frequent, hurried sips. As her mind spins with the
            thoughts of forgotten homework, she frantically checks her son’s
            backpack for one last time. As they approach their stop, she quickly
            gathers her son’s backpack and lunch bag and walks with him to the
            school entrance. She kneels to kiss his forehead, sending him off
            with an “I love you” and the quiet reassurance, “Mommy’s so proud of
            you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As the mother and son duo disappear into the crowd, a young man
            rushes onto the bus, breathless and flushed. He adjusts his headset
            and grabs onto the nearest rail as a gravely ill patient clings to
            life. His gaze drifts to the exit sign as he gets lost in thoughts
            that seem as endless as the road ahead. He is jolted out of his
            thoughts as more backpacks squeeze in and shove him into a corner.
            As he struggles to find even the smallest bit of room, he grips
            another rail, clenching his fists to avoid the irritated glances
            from the seated passengers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The seated passengers are all fascinating creatures. A middle-aged
            blonde woman, vibrant and full of life, sits next to a girl who
            appears to be a university student and elaborates on her time living
            in a downtown Vancouver trailer. As she broadcasts her street life
            struggles and the petty battles fought over scraps of food, the
            student listens politely, occasionally nodding and smiling to keep
            up the pretense of interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seated behind them, an elderly man is lost in a different era — the
            1970s — when paper maps were still around. “I drove to every corner,
            correcting the maps before anyone else could,” he boasts to his
            neighbor, who listens with eyebrows raised in awe. In sheer
            amazement, his neighbor lets out a “wow” as he lists the
            discrepancies in today’s Google Maps. As they shake hands in
            parting, a newfound trust forms between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            As some passengers smile in awe at this new friendship, others turn
            their curious heads to the loud bunch at the back. Dressed in light
            blue scrubs and cushioned white shoes, a cluster of nursing students
            quiz each other, sharing the stress and urgency of their last-minute
            cramming with the bus and providing everyone with a free lesson on
            taking medical history. As they prepare to get off at their stop,
            the murmurs of medical jargon fade.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bus ride in Edmonton is indeed, a mosaic of stories. From a mother
            who wants to ensure that her son is not late to school, to a group
            of last-minute, cramming nursing students who want to pass their
            midterms, each ride introduces us to many stories and many goals.
            Though the journey is brief, each bus becomes a vessel for a lot of
            dreams. And, each ride offers something unique — whether it’s the
            ability to maintain patience and virtue so that someone else feels
            comfortable, or the solace in a slowly budding friendship.
          </p>
          <p>
            When passengers step off at their respective stops, they carry with
            them a small but significant piece of someone else’s life — as a
            memento of the journey that lingers long after the ride has ended.
