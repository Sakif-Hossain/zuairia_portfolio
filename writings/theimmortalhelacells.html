            Defined as, “unending existence” by the Merriam-Webster
            dictionary,[1] the topic of immortality is subject to various
            controversial opinions. Associated with the afterlife, it is one of
            those topics that lie in the grey areas. Humans are not immortal,
            but a special line of cells - the HeLa cells - is. Although the
            owner of these cells died of cervical cancer on October 4 1951, the
            cells continued to divide and are dividing as we speak.[2]
          </p>
          <p>
            Henrietta Lacks was a black Virginian tobacco farmer, born as
            Loretta Pleasant on August 1, 1920. She later renamed herself as
            Henrietta. Following her mother’s death in 1924, she went to live
            with her grandfather. At that time, she met her first cousin, David
            Lacks, who she later married and had 5 children with.[6] Unsettled
            by continuous vaginal bleeding, Lacks went to John Hopkins Hospital
            on January 29, 1951. Soon, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer.
            In the course of radiation therapy, doctors drew out two samples
            from her cervix without her consent.[2][3] The cell samples reached
            Dr George Otto Gey’s lab, who was a cell biologist back then. To
            Gey’s surprise, Lacks’ cells doubled every 20-24 hours, although he
            had expected her cells to die like all prior cell samples. Gey
            isolated Lacks’ cells and created a cell line, naming it “HeLa,”
            derived from the first two letters of her first and last name.[6]
          </p>
          <p>
            The immortality of the HeLa cell line raised a lot of questions back
            then. One of those was about its nature. Chromosomes have a region
            called the “telomere,” which are like disposable caps. Without
            telomeres, chromosomes would lose valuable genetic information.
            After each cell division, a bit of the telomere is chopped off. The
            length of telomeres hence determines the lifespan of cells.
            Telomerase is an enzyme that adds bases to telomeres and prevents
            them from being used up, so the cells don’t die. In cancer, cells
            continuously divide and telomerase production increases. As a
            result, the telomeres don’t shorten and the cells don’t die. This
            causes a tumour to form. HeLa cells produce a lot of telomerase
            during cell division, leading to immortality. Additionally,
            scientists have estimated a total of 76-80 chromosomes in HeLa cells
            as opposed to 46 chromosomes in normal cells. This includes 22-25
            abnormal chromosomes, due to HeLa being a rapidly dividing cancer
            cell line. We are yet to find out a viable justification as to why
            HeLa cells are the way they are. The only educated guess scientists
            have been able to make is from Henrietta’s diagnosis of syphilis,
            which seemed to have made her tumour more lethal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 1951, HeLa cells have been a reason for the advancement of
            medicine. The cell line was assessed with radiation and used to
            develop drugs that treat Parkinson’s Disease, leukaemia, influenza,
            sexually transmitted diseases, appendicitis, mosquito mating, human
            longevity, lactose digestion, and a lot more.[4][5] HeLa cells also
            contributed to space missions to research what happens to human
            tissues beyond the gravitational force of the earth. Unusually so,
            scientists discovered that HeLa cells divide even more quickly in
            zero gravity. The findings from these experiments have led to
            countless pieces of knowledge that have shaped modern-day medicine
            and formulated the basis of the latest medical technologies we have
            today. One researcher even estimated that if you laid the HeLa cells
            end-to-end, they’d wrap around the planet at least 3 times![5]
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the creation of the HeLa cell line was miraculous for
            20th-century medicine, it was also a case of lack of informed
            consent. At that time, communication between tissue donors and
            doctors was nonexistent. Neither Lacks nor her family granted
            permission to use the cells for research purposes. As medicine
            progresses, it is important to consider: how much right do we have
            over the raw materials of our physiology? If any at all, what rights
            do the providers of the original sample (or their families) have on
            the cell line? This issue reiterates the importance of effective
            communication between doctors, patients, and their families. The
            Lacks family would’ve had an easier time processing this new
            information if they had received an explanation of what happened to
            Lacks’ cells and what they were being used for. The controversy also
            accentuates the existence of a human being behind every test tube of
            cells. It becomes all the more important to regard the story of a
            person who is more than just a biological sample.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some may look at the story of HeLa cells as racism, but that’s not
            accurate.[4] A healthy rapport between doctors and patients was not
            common in the 20th century, so it would be unfair to look down upon
            Dr Gey’s intentions. However, I thought it important to inform our
            readers about Lacks’ story as we face the Black Lives Matter crisis.
            Over the years, medical practice has improved and has reached great
            heights of achievement, which rely on the trustful relationship
            between a doctor and their patients. Hence, it is important to
            consider that Henrietta and her family had a third-grade education,
            so taking samples from her body without her knowledge is alarming
            and would be considered as malpractice if it happened today. But
            this should not trivialize tissue culture as modern medicine is
            largely dependent on it. Without tissue culture, we would not have
            life-changing medical treatments, so it would be safe to say that
            tissue culture is essential for research. What we do need to do is
            find a way to conduct such experiments that every one relevant to
            the case approves of.
