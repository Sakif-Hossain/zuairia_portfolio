            I remember my mom running around crazily, looking for me when I
            wasn’t around (probably because I was busy playing hide-and-seek!).
            The instant she heard me sneezing, she’d clean the house to the
            point where you’d see your reflection on the floor. And God forbid
            I’d have a cold or a fever; she’d be up all night. Well, I guess
            being the firstborn has its perks. From what I have heard from my
            aunts’, she’d be obsessing over me so much that she would misplace
            things all the time. But what often came across as a surprise to me
            was how my mom would know what I wanted before I even asked for it.
            Mothers are strange. Somehow, they know everything. As creepy as
            that may sound, it isn’t paranoia. It’s something we identify as the
            “Mommy Brain.”[4][8]
          </p>
          <p>
            After childbirth, a mother’s brain undergoes a series of vast
            changes. Studies previously done on animals implied the occurrence
            of certain structural changes to the maternal brain during
            postpartum periods. To explore these changes in human brains, the
            National Institute of Mental Health conducted a study on 19 women
            who gave birth at Yale-New Haven Hospital.[3][2] Their brains were
            studied from two to four weeks of postpartum to three to four months
            of postpartum, through MRI scans. Quite unusually, they noticed an
            increase in the volume of the grey matter of the prefrontal cortex,
            parietal lobes, and midbrain when the mothers were looking at
            pictures of their babies. The adult brain rarely ever grows unless
            there has been significant learning, brain injury, or major
            environmental changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Pilyoung Kim, PhD, the hormonal changes during
            pregnancy make the mother’s brain predisposed to reshaping, in
            response to the baby.[2] The affected areas contribute to increased
            maternal motivation, an attempt to help the mother understand her
            child’s needs. When this happens, increased activity in the
            substantia nigra and amygdala allows a mother to process emotions,
            while the changes in the parietal lobe help with sensory
            integration, and the prefrontal cortex allow reasoning and
            judgment.[6] As the research progressed, the researchers saw that
            mothers who were very enthusiastic and rated their babies as
            special, beautiful, ideal, and perfect were significantly more
            likely to develop larger midbrains than the mothers who were
            not.[3][2]
          </p>
          <p>
            Researchers believe these changes are for the betterment of the
            mother and child because it is the foundation of the bond between
            them.[6] Making her more responsive toward her child, it helps the
            mother understand the tiny details about her child that nobody else
            would notice, including the father.[2][7] As the “mommy brain”
            remains for two years, it gives the mother ample time to understand
            her child. The bond that she is able to harbor then becomes
            ever-lasting, and I must say, I still see that side of my mom.[8]
            Due to multiple allergic reactions occurring at the same time, I
            fell unconscious three years ago and was hospitalized. A lot of my
            relatives were present, but nobody other than the doctor and my
            mother were able to understand why I had lost consciousness in the
            first place.

            The brain begins to transform slowly after the start of pregnancy.
            Neural activities are increased in the substantia nigra and
            amygdala, and nerve connections in the breast area strengthen to
            prepare the body for breastfeeding - it is truly amazing how these
            actions take place long before the birth of the baby. Despite the
            glorious side of it, these changes can also be detrimental as they
            hold the potential to make the mother overly sensitive and
            emotional, especially when thinking about the child. You may ask if
            some parts of the brain grow in volume, do other parts shrink? That
            is correct - the human body can hold only a certain amount of brain
            matter. The parts of the brain that are rarely ever required in
            motherhood do indeed shrink a bit in size during the “mommy brain”
            period, as the body learns to prioritize tasks, with the most
            important task being the baby. Hence, everything else becomes less
            significant and the mother feels no need to use the hippocampus; her
            short-term memory weakens,[1] which may be the reason why she might
            forget to turn off the gas at times![4] However, that might not be a
            bad thing. Leiden University neuroscientist, Elseline Hoekzema, says
            that the shrinkage makes the brain more specialized and efficient
            after the “mommy brain” period as unnecessary neuronal connections
            are eliminated.[5][7]
          </p>
          <p>
            It is crucial to note that the findings from this research have been
            done on a small sample size.[3] Hence, we cannot use this knowledge
            to treat every mother as pregnancy affects every woman
            differently.[3] But what we can do, is appreciate the fact that a
            fetus affects a mother as much as the mother affects the fetus.
            Oftentimes, people are only bothered about the baby. When my mom was
            pregnant with my little sister, I would see relatives coming over
            now and then and ask about the little one, rather than trying to
            know how my mom was doing - this used to be a typical scene in Asian
            households, but thankfully, it is now changing. We rarely ever know
            what changes a mother is actually going through during pregnancy
            unless we experience it ourselves. A massive responsibility is added
            to the many more responsibilities she already has, which can be
            overwhelming because an infant’s life now depends on her. The least
            we can do as family members, partners, or children, is to let the
            mother know that it is perfectly fine to feel so overwhelmed and
            divide the responsibilities so she can focus on enhancing the bond
            with her child.
