            The ideological synchronicity between Indian youth and historical
            revolutionaries is a central theme in Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s Rang
            De Basanti, hereinafter RDB. By dissolving the boundaries between
            the personal and the political, RDB revitalizes transgenerational
            relationships. Drawing on Sikata Banerjee’s discussion of muscular
            nationalism and Charu Gupta’s exploration of maternal metaphors, I
            argue that political awakening is less a product of formal education
            and more a result of lived experiences shaped by personal loss and
            inherited legacy. Particularly, I will focus on the film’s
            soundtrack, an often-overlooked narrative device that follows the
            protagonists’ transition from political apathy to enlightenment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mehra critiques political indifference and institutionalized
            education with the satirical “Masti Ki Paathshaala” (RDB 16:10). The
            protagonists’ repeated declaration of “loose control” and “I’m a
            rebel” (20:08-26) highlights their dismissal of formal education and
            defiance of societal norms. Their rebellion critiques the value of
            institutionalized education that does not prepare the youth for
            real-world challenges, a concern DJ raises with Sue (45:53-47:20).
            Instead, the protagonists engage in a communal and experiential
            approach to learning. This critique aligns with contemporary debates
            about outdated educational models, which can neglect emotional
            intelligence and critical engagement. Although typical for young
            university students, Aslam’s sarcastic remark about “studying” being
            an accusation instead of a privilege (16:55-17:02) suggests that
            formal education falls short in leaving a lasting impression on
            students and equipping them with skills that will help them
            understand their social responsibilities. Karan’s admission in the
            nightclub that he cannot relate to India’s freedom fighters further
            amplifies the youth’s detachment from their national history (RDB
            89:33-90:27). By embedding a critique of traditional education in
            the satirical yet reflective “Masti Ki Paathshaala,” Mehra pushes us
            to question whether traditional education fosters empathy and
            critical engagement necessary to tackle societal challenges, and if
            we have what it takes to retaliate against unjust politics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using “Luka Chuppi,” Mehra underscores personal loss (RDB
            106:23-110:28) as one of the factors that can shatter political
            apathy. This duet between a mourning Aishwarya and a deceased Ajay
            juxtaposes maternal grief with the bittersweet liberation of
            martyrdom. With the evening approaching and Aishwarya’s eyesight
            blurring (107:00-15), a deeper sense of grief arrives,
            metaphorically symbolizing a mother’s instinctive but futile
            attempts to connect with her deceased child. In response to
            Aishwarya’s requests, Ajay describes his newfound liberation, which
            comes at the cost of detachment from his loved ones (109:50-110:20).
            His sacrifice is reflected in the dichotomy of the song’s lyrics,
            where his lines – sung by A.R. Rahman – introduce new developments,
            but Aishwarya’s lines – sung by Lata Mangeshkar – are consistently
            unresponsive to the details mentioned. The dissonance between
            Aishwarya’s static refrain and Ajay’s evolving diction stiffens this
            unbridgeable, one-sided conversation where Aishwarya remains
            woefully unaware of Ajay’s replies. This disconnection between the
            living and the dead, and Aishwarya’s personal grief, project on a
            national scale as she embodies “Mother India,” who is mourning for
            her lost sons (Harrington 6). Gupta’s assertion that the maternal
            metaphor unifies citizens under nationalist ideals (4291) is evident
            in the sentimental appeal of RDB, as all protagonists feel a sense
            of obligation and protectiveness toward Aishwarya. While I agree
            with Gupta’s claim that the misuse of such symbolisms by right-wing
            Hindu politicians can impose ultranationalism, especially
            implicating marginalized populations (4292), I argue that such
            associations also help citizens forge genuine connections with their
            lands. It is instinctive not only for men but everyone, to protect
            and care for their parents. If the nation is metaphorically a
            mother, then its citizens are her children. This symbolism thus
            makes social issues a family matter, ultimately inspiring the public
            to be more involved in society. However, with RDB and many other
            films, Bollywood has overused the “Mother India” trope, diluting its
            potency (Harrington 6). This raises questions about the violence
            portrayed by the protagonists, whether it truly brings justice for
            Ajay, or if it is their way to mask personal vendetta in the name of
            patriotism. Despite the male protagonists’ sacrifices, Ajay cannot
            return, and some relationships, such as Aishwarya’s and Ajay’s, will
            remain severed forever. This bleak representation of grief prompts
            us to consider if the outcome for Ajay would be different if the
            protagonists had raised their voices against the MiG-21 jet plane
            scam when they first learned about it instead of behaving
            apathetically (RDB 43:13-26). Taking Ajay’s death into
            consideration, I argue that Mehra aims to evoke a sense of guilt in
            his viewers, critiquing society’s tendency to remain politically
            disengaged until they experience consequences personally, and
            underscoring how much we can lose if we do not fight.
          </p>
          <p>
            While personal and familial sacrifices are pivotal in promoting
            political consciousness, Mehra also demonstrates the significance of
            inherited legacy in “Lalkaar” (RDB 95:15-97:39). Popularised by Ram
            Prasad Bismil, the revolutionary Laxman reenacts, “Lalkaar”
            explicitly binds the actions of the young protagonists to the ideals
            of the historical revolutionaries. As the protagonists claim to
            “wear a shroud” (96:55-97:12), they mirror the ethos of their
            predecessors who also accepted martyrdom. This imagery of death in
            “Lalkaar” creates a sense of continuity in the values that drive
            revolutionary movements across generations. The declaration of
            “revolution in [their] veins” captures their ancestors’ collective
            passion (97:14-17), reinforcing that individual lives are transient
            compared to the lasting impact of revolutionary action. Even though
            it takes them a while, the protagonists in RDB understand their role
            as the next link in the chain of resistance and change. We could
            argue that it is not possible to inherit the legacy of those who are
            not tied to us by blood, but Mehra implores us to view RDB as the
            story of a group of friends who metaphorically inherit the
            historical revolutionaries’ patriotism by reenacting their
            struggles. “Lalkaar” also features a reenactment of the peaceful
            protest against the Simon Commission (96:50), which is recreated
            during the candle march for Ajay in “Khoon Chala” (111:50),
            metaphorically intertwining the dimensions of the past and present.
            However, the protagonists not only inherit their ancestors’
            political ideology, but their desire for personal vengeance as well.
            Just as the historical revolutionaries avenged the death of Lala
            Lajpat Rai (97:39), a father figure, by assassinating James Scott
            (98:23-99:15), the protagonists retaliate against the Defence
            Minister for Ajay’s death (RDB 128:40-129:58), with Aishwarya
            standing as their moral anchor. The synchronicity in the actions of
            the historical revolutionaries and the protagonists thus reinforces
            that our present-day identities are the products of our ancestors’
            struggles for justice. Rochona Majumdar’s comment about songs
            unifying emotions and memories across temporal divides aptly
            registers in RDB (109) because Mehra uses the soundtrack to connect
            the past and present. Through such portrayal of transgenerational
            relationships, Mehra attempts to redefine patriotism as a sense of
            loyalty, not only towards one’s country but also towards one’s
            family, blood-related or not. Mehra’s portrayal of patriotic legacy
            also urges us to consider what we define as patriotism, and if the
            loyalty we feel for our families extends to our nations as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Mehra’s definition of patriotism raises questions about
            exclusion. Banerjee critiques India’s, and accordingly Mehra’s,
            reliance on “muscular nationalism” as a symbol of global
            triumphalism, which finds vivid expression in the male protagonists’
            ultimate sacrifice (2-3). By demonstrating this androcentric climax,
            Mehra risks exhibiting exclusionary nationalism, disseminating the
            idea that women are not allowed to be national heroes. Reiterating
            Mehra’s representation of “Mother India,” we could also argue that
            he unintentionally illustrates the metaphorical mother nation
            favoring the sacrifices of her sons while rejecting the dedication
            of her daughters. Contrary to Banerjee’s claims, I do not believe
            Sonia merely “[begs] her friends to avenge Ajay’s death” or “remains
            on the side-lines” (67). Considering the political neutrality Sonia
            initially maintains, it is notable that in her timeline, she
            suggests murder as punishment (RDB 127:35-53), mirroring Durgawati
            Devi’s boldness. Additionally, if a comatose Aishwarya is truly
            “reminiscent of the suffering motherland” (Banerjee 65) then
            certainly as her caretaker in the hospital (RDB 117:10-30), Sonia
            emerges as an unwavering and committed patriot. Aishwarya defeats
            the frail characteristics of her archetype as well; during the
            candlelight vigil in “Khoon Chala,” Sonia and Aishwarya are not
            alarmed by the baton charge, unlike the other protagonists
            (114:00-15). However, we could also argue that they are primarily
            driven by the movement because it concerns Ajay. It is therefore
            questionable if they would still act persistently had it been
            another soldier in Ajay’s place. This reinstates Mehra’s critique of
            reactive activism, which is driven almost exclusively by personal
            loss, and his emphasis on sustained, dedicated engagement with
            political matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pavitra Sundar’s concept of the “deejay aesthetic” encapsulates
            Mehra’s use of music to “remix” fragments of the past so that it is
            relatable to present-day youth. DJ’s name, symbolically linked to
            this aesthetic, underscores the film’s intent to retell historical
            narratives dynamically (Sundar). Mehra’s reimagination of history
            provides viewers with another opportunity to relearn, reengage, and
            reinterpret history as a part of their identity that demands
            critical engagement, rather than simply accepting it as foreign,
            distant, and superficial facts. In essence, Rang De Basanti urges us
            to redefine patriotism, bridging the past and present through acts
            of sustained political engagement. Mehra’s call for continual
            engagement reminds us that our nations are eagerly waiting for us to
            act so that we can protect our loved ones. As we step into the
            future, we must accept our social responsibility of ensuring that
            the legacy we leave behind honors not only our ancestors but our
            descendants as well.
