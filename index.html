							<blockquote style="padding: 0em 1em;"><p>“I am no bird; and no net ensnares me.” - Charlotte Brontë</p></blockquote>
							<p>The quote by Brontë above relates to me on so many levels. It reminds me of all the bold decisions I have taken over the course of my life so far. The most recent example would be changing majors, at a point in my career where I am only two semesters away from graduating. </p>
							<p>After toiling tirelessly in a Bachelor of Science Specialization in Immunology and Infection for three years, I realized how unhappy and unsatisfied I was with the curriculum. I learned all these meticulous details about the inner workings of the human immune system, but it all seemed worthless. By memorizing which specific cytokines are released when one sneezes, or has a parasitic infection, who was I really benefitting? I stuck with that major for a long time, and it served as a constant reminder of my lack of interest in Immunology. </p>
							<p>My life consisted of countless exams, quizzes, and lab reports. But what I craved every single day was writing. I wanted to translate the specialized knowledge I had gained from Immunology into words that can actually relate to the general public. Being an Immunology student has helped me realize that there is a lot of research out there, being conducted for the sole purpose of improving health and healthcare ultimately, but people don’t know about it. Research findings are not always translated in a way that helps people understand its implications and consequences. Communication, more often than not, seems to be a barrier between the general public and researchers, when in actuality, many researchers are doing what they do to benefit us. </p>
							<p>And so, I changed majors, going from a Specialization in Immunology and Infection to a Biological Sciences major and English minor, in the hope that the minor will mold me into a person that communicates well, and is able to bridge the gap between researchers and the general public. I do not know if this was the right way to go, but I do know that this bold decision will at least, give me a head start in making a positive change. </p>
